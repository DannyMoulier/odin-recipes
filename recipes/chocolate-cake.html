    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>A chocolate cake is a rich, decadent dessert that is made
        from a combination of cocoa powder, flour, sugar, eggs, and butter or oil.
        The batter is typically mixed together and baked in the oven until it
        rises and becomes fluffy and moist. Once cooled, the cake can be layered with
        frosting or other toppings, such as whipped cream or fresh berries, to enhance
        its flavor and presentation. Chocolate cakes are beloved for their indulgent,
        chocolatey taste and are often served at special occasions or enjoyed as a
        treat with a cup of coffee or tea.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>

    </ul>
