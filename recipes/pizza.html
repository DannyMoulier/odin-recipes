    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>A pizza is a delicious Italian dish made from a thin, round
        dough base that is typically topped with tomato sauce,
        cheese, and various ingredients such as meats, vegetables,
        herbs, and spices. It is typically baked in a hot oven until
        the crust is crispy and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Pizzas
        come in many different styles and varieties, ranging from classic
        Margherita and Pepperoni to gourmet options like BBQ chicken and
        pesto with goat cheese. Pizzas are a popular food around the world
        and can be enjoyed as a meal or as a snack.</p>

        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the sauce</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>100ml passata</li>
        <li>handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the topping</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>125g ball mozzarella, sliced</li>
        <li>handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)</li>
        <li>handful of cherry tomatoes, halved</li>

        <li>handful of basil leaves (optional)</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the
            yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive
            oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft,
            fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for
            5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can
            leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a
            thin crust.</li>

        <li>
            Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together,
            then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you
            get on with shaping the base.</li>

        <li>Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick
            knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out
            the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin.
            The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the
            rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li>

        <li>240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray
            in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of
            a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and
            season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated
            sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more
            olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li>

    </ol>
